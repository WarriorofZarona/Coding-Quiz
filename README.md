Homework #4

I need to create a timed multiple-choice quiz that tracks the score of the user using updating HTML and CSS powered by Javascript.

The plan is to build in HTML and CSS first to get a general idea of what the game should look like, then rebuild using Javascript.

Buttons should be used to start the quiz, and any answer will proceed to the next question while letting the user know if the answer is correct or wrong.

At the end of the quiz, the user will be shown the score and allowed to type in their initials, which will go into a list of highscores.

My goal is to have the bare minimum HTML and CSS and have everything be built in JS.
